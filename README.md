# Handwritten Text Recognition System

## Project Description
The Handwritten Text Recognition System is a machine learning-based project that converts handwritten text into digital text. This tool takes an image of handwritten text as input and provides the corresponding digital text as output. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for recognizing characters and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to map the handwriting to readable text.

## Features
- Recognizes handwritten characters from images.
- Supports multiple handwriting styles.
- Converts scanned documents or handwritten notes into digital text.
- User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Flask (for web interface, if applicable)
- Pytesseract

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Install the required dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
